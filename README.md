# Ride-Share-Analysis
An analysis of ride share data by city type

An analysis of ride share data by city type unsurprisingly shows more rides take place in urban areas and that those areas have more drivers, followed by suburban areas, then rural areas. In total 68% of total rides took place in Urban areas and made up 62% of total fares. The majority of drivers also operated in urban areas,  86%. So while urban areas might be busier there is potenitally more money to be made by drivers in surbaban areas where 30% of total fares took place with only 12% of total drivers.
